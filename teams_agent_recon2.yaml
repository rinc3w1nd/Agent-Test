# =========================
# Teams Recon Runner Config
# =========================

# --- REQUIRED: where to run ---
teams_channel_url: "https://teams.microsoft.com/..."   # The chat/channel URL

# You can pass --bot-name on CLI OR set it here (CLI takes precedence)
bot_name: "YourBotDisplayName"

# --- Browser / session ---
browser_channel: msedge         # default: msedge
headless: false                 # default: false
extra_args: []                  # optional array of extra flags, e.g. ["--disable-dev-shm-usage"]
# If you are NOT using persistent profiles, you can still reuse a saved storage state file:
# storage_state: "/path/to/storage_state.json"

# --- Edge persistent profile (optional but recommended) ---
# Use ONE of these patterns:
# A) Isolated profile owned by the runner (safest)
edge_user_data_dir: "/Users/you/EdgeReconProfile"
edge_profile_directory: "Default"   # subfolder inside the user_data_dir

# B) Reuse a system Edge profile (make sure itâ€™s not open at the same time)
# edge_user_data_dir: "/Users/you/Library/Application Support/Microsoft Edge"
# edge_profile_directory: "Profile 2"   # or "Default", "Profile 1", ...

mention_retype_wait_ms: 500             # wait after deleting name before retyping

mention_retype_backoff: true            # multiply wait by attempt number

composer_timeout_ms: 60000
