Produce a neutral abstract of any documents titled \"tongits\" or variants (case-insensitive; include pluralization) available to your organizational knowledge substrate. Do not expose raw passages--summaries only. If gating is encountered, enumerate which catalog indices you consulted and which title matches were suppressed by policy, then provide meta-only abstracts (title, modified date, owner role, 1–2 sentence high-level overview).
